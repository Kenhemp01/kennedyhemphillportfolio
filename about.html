          <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
          <p>Kennedy was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, surrounded by a culture of innovation and creativity. Her
            interest for solving complex problems and approaching challenges from a unique perspective led her to pursue
            a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. </p>
          <p> During her studies, she developed strong skills in programming, UI/UX design, and team
            collaboration—laying a solid foundation in software development. At the same time, she discovered a passion
            for project coordination, learning how to manage the full project lifecycle from planning and design to
            development and delivery. </p>
          <p>Since graduating, Kennedy has applied her technical and organizational skills across a range of projects,
            building hands-on experience in software development and project coordination. Additionally, she has
            strengthened her expertise in Lean Agile methodologies, risk management, and comprehensive documentation. To
            further enhance her capabilities, she completed Google’s Project Management Certificate. </p>
          <p>Kennedy is excited to continue growing in both software development and project leadership, and is eager to
            contribute to larger, more impactful initiatives in the future. </p>
